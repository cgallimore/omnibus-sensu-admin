{"name":"Omnibus-sensu-admin","tagline":"Omnibus for Sensu Admin","body":"# sensu-admin Omnibus project\r\n\r\nThis project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for\r\n`sensu-admin`!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nWe'll assume you have Ruby 1.9+ and Bundler installed. First ensure all\r\nrequired gems are installed and ready to use:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bundle install --binstubs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nYou create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bin/omnibus build project sensu-admin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform\r\nwhere the `build project` command is invoked. So running this command on say a\r\nMacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X specific package. After the build\r\ncompletes packages will be available in `pkg/`.\r\n\r\n### Clean\r\n\r\nYou can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with\r\nthe `clean` command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bin/omnibus clean\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the\r\nbuild including the project install directory (`/opt/sensu-admin`) and\r\nthe package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bin/omnibus clean --purge\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Help\r\n\r\nFull help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the\r\n`help` command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bin/omnibus help\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Vagrant-based Virtualized Build Lab\r\n\r\nEvery Omnibus project ships will a project-specific\r\n[Berksfile](http://berkshelf.com/) and [Vagrantfile](http://www.vagrantup.com/)\r\nthat will allow you to build your projects on the following platforms:\r\n\r\n* CentOS 5 64-bit\r\n* CentOS 6 64-bit\r\n* Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit\r\n* Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit\r\n* Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit\r\n\r\nPlease note this build-lab is only meant to get you up and running quickly;\r\nthere's nothing inherent in Omnibus that restricts you to just building CentOS\r\nor Ubuntu packages. See the Vagrantfile to add new platforms to your build lab.\r\n\r\nThe only requirements for standing up this virtualized build lab are:\r\n\r\n* VirtualBox - native packages exist for most platforms and can be downloaded\r\nfrom the [VirtualBox downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\r\n* Vagrant 1.2.1+ - native packages exist for most platforms and can be downloaded\r\nfrom the [Vagrant downloads page](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).\r\n\r\nThe [vagrant-berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/vagrant-berkshelf) and\r\n[vagrant-omnibus](https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus) Vagrant plugins\r\nare also required and can be installed easily with the following commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf\r\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the pre-requisites are installed you can build your package across all\r\nplatforms with the following command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you would like to build a package for a single platform the command looks like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant up PLATFORM\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe complete list of valid platform names can be viewed with the\r\n`vagrant status` command.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
